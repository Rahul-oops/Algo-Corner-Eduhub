          <h3>Fostering Creativity and Problem-Solving Skills</h3>
          <p>Coding is a route to creativity and problem-solving, and it involves more than just learning a computer language. Children who learn to code have the chance to generate interactive stories, make digital art, and design their own games. They are inspired to think creatively and innovatively as a result, which encourages imagination.
             Problem-solving abilities are even more important in rural settings where resources may be limited. PWD Kids who learn to code are more equipped to face problems head-on, find answers, and put those solutions into practise. I saw kids in my neighbourhood exhibit an astounding degree of inventiveness and adaptation through coding projects.</p>

        <div class="facilities-col">
          <img src="./images/g2.png" alt="">
          <h3>Encouraging Collaboration and Community Building</h3>
          <p>Collaboration is frequently necessary for coding projects, especially for real-world uses. This feature of coding education, which encourages teamwork and community development, can be very helpful to children in remote regions. PWD Kids in my neighbourhood started to bond, exchange ideas, and work together on projects at coding workshops.Beyond local connections, learning to code gives children the chance to interact with peers and mentors from around the globe. Through online coding groups and tools, they can work together with people who share their interests while overcoming distance barriers.</p>

        <div class="facilities-col">
          <img src="./images/g3.png" alt="">
          <h3>Enhancing Future Career Opportunities</h3>
          <p>Coding skills are now highly sought after by companies across a range of industries in a labour market that is continually changing. We are preparing children for a future in which technology will play an increasingly important role by introducing coding education in rural areas of PWD students.
             Kids develop important skills like critical thinking, logical reasoning, and attention to detail through coding education. They will have a competitive advantage when they enter the labour market because these talents are transferable to many different professions. Further broadening their views, coding enables them to investigate new job pathways in industries they might not have previously thought about.</p>
